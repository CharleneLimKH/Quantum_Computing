Source  : Erbil Polytechnic University, University of Kurdistan Hewler

## Objective

The objective in this milestone is to do a preliminary test on Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and Particle Swarm Optimization Feedforward Neural Network (PSOFNN) for health data classification.

Firstly, I applied FNN to perform heart disease data classification. Since the data has been preprocessed, I've only have to run minimal data transformation  which are normalization of the features and the target. Three optimizers (SGD, Adam, and RMSprop) have been tested to compare the training and test results. 

Subsequently, I applied PSO to train FNN on the same dataset.
